# module-3-homework

## Description

I created this password generator to apply what I have been learning about Javascript in module 3.

## Usage 

When navigating to the page, there are prompts for the length of the password and which character sets are wanted (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters). After the prompts, click on the "Generate Password" button to see a randomly generated password.
